                    <p>
                        My name is Bronwen, and I am currently enrolled in U of T's School of Continuing Education Coding Bootcamp
                        program.
                        Much of my work has been in administration and customer service, but I decided to take this course so that I
                        could upgrade
                        my skills. I have a strong desire to help others, particularly those with disabilities like myself, and I hope
                        to find a job in
                        the future that will enable me to do so. When I am not at work or school, I enjoy singing in choir, pet-sitting,
                        and spending
                        time with family and friends.
